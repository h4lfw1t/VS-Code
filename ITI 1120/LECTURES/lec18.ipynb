    "### What Data Types Have We Seen So Far?\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we have use integers(int), floats(float),strings(str), lists(list), booleans(bool), sets(set), dictionaries(dict), tuples(tuple), and NoneType.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all built-in data types native to Python.\n",
    "A non-native data type we have seen is turtle; a data type imported using import.turtle.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we make our own data types? And why would we want to do so?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to represent n points on a plane. Imagine what pieces of data you need to represent a single, unique point? Naturally, you should come to the realization that you need both an *x* and a *y* coordinate as seperate pieces of data to represent the unique location of a point in a two-dimensional plane. Another way to represent the same point would be using the *distance from the origin (c)* and the *angle* the *c* makes with the horizontal *x*-axis. In both cases, two specific pieces of data are required; you cannot have the unique point without both pieces of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using *x* and *y* to represent the location of a point in 2-D, using built-in data types, these would likely be stored in a matrix such that p[i][j] would represent a point *i* where its *x* coordinate is p[i][0] and its *y* coordinate is p[i][1].\n",
    "\n",
    "How could you create a more simple way to store these unique points? By creating a specific data type that stores points.\n"

    "The __init__() function is the function that actually creates data for the class to use. It is the function that is called when you create a new instance of the class.
