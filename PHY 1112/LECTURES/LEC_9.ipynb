    "While there doesn't appear to be much difference between a list and a 1D ndarray, the ndarray is much more powerful and flexible. For example, you can perform mathematical operations on the entire array at once, and you can easily reshape the array into a 2D or 3D array.\n",
    "Indexing arrays and slicing arrays looks very similar to list slicing. For example, to get the first 3 elements of the array, you would use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "print(a[:3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a 2d array with numpy, you can access specific elements in both the columns and rows of the list by using typical slicing notation, such as array[0, 1] to access the element in the first row and second column. You can also use slicing to access entire rows or columns of the array. For example, array[0, :] will return the entire first row of the array, and array[:, 1] will return the entire second column of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\n",

    "\n",
    "Typically when working with lists containing large data sets, each data address would have to be accessed individually in order to perform operations on the data using for loops and similar funtions. This results in rather 'slow' execution, with is unideal for large data sets. NumPy, on the other hand, facilitates vectorized computation to replace python loops. Vectorization means that the loops are not done in python code, but rather by pre-compiled C code, which is much faster. This is one of the reasons why NumPy is so much faster than standard python lists. This is possible due to the fixed size and fixed type of an ndarray, which allows for the array to be stored in a single block of memory. This allows for fast access to the elements in the array, and also allows for fast mathematical operations on the entire array."

This is very useful when working with large data sets, as it allows for fast and efficient computation of large matrices.
